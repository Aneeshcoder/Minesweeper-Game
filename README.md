# Minesweeper-Game
**Implimentation of Minesweeper game using C programming language.**</br></br>
Minesweeper is one of the game which probably everyone have played in his/her childhood.</br>
But most of us doesn't even know how to play it.</br></br>
So here I have implimented Minesweeper game with most basic commands in C programming language.</br>
For better understanding of fflush I have given a specific code to get the concept of fflush clear.</br>
Levels in this level corresponds to number of mines and size of matrix in the game.</br></br>
This minesweeper game contain 3 different level:
1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Advanced
